Hello! My name is Odhy Pradhana. I’m an accountant at a regional government finance institution, and a Python developer on the side.

I picked up Python as a hobby and found joy in automating the boring stuff: web tasks, spreadsheets, reports, and other everyday workflows.
Lately, I’ve been diving into data science, especially learning how to tell better stories through [data visualization].

[data visualization]: /topics/data-visualization

I'm passionate about building simple, useful tools that help people work smarter.
Right now, I'm especially interested in how thoughtful design and visual storytelling can make complex information more meaningful and impactful.

Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time in nature, from hiking mountains to exploring quiet beaches. I also play guitar and piano, and occasionally unwind with a game or two on Steam.
