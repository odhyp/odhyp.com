## A Python Developer who loves web automations, tackling Excel and PDFs—turning those boring 9-to-5 tasks into something manageable.

Welcome to my portfolio and blog website. I mostly code in Python and get a kick out of building automations. I also dabble in front-end stuff with Hugo, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS—like this very website you're on. 

I write blogs! Just like all those great programmers out there. I share tips about Python libraries, front-end tricks, my take on music (which usually means talking about Radiohead), and bits of my personal life.

Thanks for stopping by—feel free to explore, and hit me up if you’re into the same stuff or anything along those lines.
