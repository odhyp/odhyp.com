## Python Developer with a Passion for Automation

Welcome to my portfolio and blog! I code in Python, automate tasks, and simplify 9-to-5 routines. I also work on front-end projects with Hugo, JavaScript, and TailwindCSS. My blog covers Python tips, front-end tricks, music (mostly Radiohead), and bits of my personal life.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”explore and reach out if you're into the same stuff. ðŸ˜Ž
