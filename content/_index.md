Hello! I'm Odhy Pradhana, an accountant and Python developer.

I'm passionate about building simple, practical applications. I use Python to automate tasks, streamline processes, and unlock deeper insights from data. You can explore my [projects] to see these tools in action.

[projects]: /projects

Currently, I'm exploring data science, focusing on how to make data _talk_ through compelling visualizations. It's about turning numbers into clear, actionable stories.

My [digital garden] is where I share my ongoing learning, project logs, and ideas on programming, data, and technology. It's a living space that grows as I explore new concepts and reflect on my journey.

Outside of programming, you can usually find me out in nature, spending time with my wife and our two feline overlords, or jamming on my guitar and piano.
