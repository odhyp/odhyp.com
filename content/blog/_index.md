## I write stuffs.

I document all sorts of things—Python scripts and packages, front-end frameworks, my love for music, gaming adventures, bits of my personal life, and whatever else catches my eye. Whether it’s diving into code, geeking out over a new game, or just sharing a playlist I can’t stop listening to, you’ll find it all here.

Hope you find something interesting—thanks for stopping by my blog!
