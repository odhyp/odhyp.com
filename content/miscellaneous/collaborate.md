I'm open to working together on tools, automation, data workflows, or turning ideas into working prototypes.

If you need help with Python scripting, data visualization, Excel cleanup, web scraping, or something else in my [projects] vibe, feel free to reach out.

I’m especially interested in practical projects that solve real problems.

> _Note: I’m currently available for freelance or short-term collaborations._
