Welcome to the "**How this site was made**" page where I explain each component used in this personal website, digital garden, service platform, digital space, or whatever this site currently is.

## Philosophy

I believe in building things that are simple, fast, and transparent. This site reflects that: no bloat, no tracking beyond the basics, and everything is handcrafted in markdown. It's a space for learning in public, documenting what I explore, and keeping a digital trail of my thoughts.

## Built With

The site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (v0.147.3), a fast static site generator. For styling, I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (v4), which lets me build designs directly in the markup using utility classes.

A few Tailwind plugins help with typography and scrollbar styling. The site uses the Tailwind CLI instead of PostCSS, keeping the setup simple.

## Development Tools

- Prettier formats the code with help from plugins for Tailwind CSS and Go templates
- Hugo Pipes minifies the CSS and adds cache-busting hashes
- All posts are written manually in Markdown and pushed to GitHub
- Deployed via Cloudflare Pages

## Fonts and Design

I use **Inter** for my articles or page contents and **Geist Mono** for everything else. Icons are provided by [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/). The design is minimal, fast, and readable on all screen sizes.

## Integrations

- [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) enables comments through GitHub Discussions
- Google Analytics tracks basic site metrics

## Growth Stages

Every post on this site has a growth stage indicating how complete and comprehensive it is.

| Name      | Completeness | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sapling   | ðŸŒ± 0â€“40%     | A fresh seed of thought. Unpolished and possibly incomplete.       |
| Growing   | ðŸŒ¿ 40â€“90%    | Developing with more structure and clarity. Still evolving.        |
| Evergreen | ðŸŒ³ 90â€“100%   | Mature and stable. Well-formed, regularly reviewed and maintained. |

> In a perfect world, every post would become Evergreen. But some ideas linger as Saplings... half-grown, half-forgotten, and waiting for rain.

## Notes

This site is always evolving. It's part personal lab, part public notebook. If you're curious about what's changed over time, check the [Changelog](/changelog) page.
