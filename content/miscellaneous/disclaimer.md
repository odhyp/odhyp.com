Everything you read on this site is shared with good intentions. I do my best to make sure the info is accurate and useful, but I can’t promise it’s always perfect or up to date.

This is my personal corner of the internet. The thoughts here are mine and don't represent anyone I work with, past or present.

Nothing here is legal, financial, or professional advice. If you end up rewriting your life based on a blog post I wrote at 1 AM, please double-check with a real expert first.

Sometimes I link to other websites. I only link to things I think are worth sharing, but I don’t have control over what’s on those sites.

If something looks off, broken, or weird, let me know!
