This site collects minimal data. Just enough to understand whatâ€™s working and to improve your experience.

### Analytics

- I use **Google Analytics** and **Cloudflare Analytics** to gather anonymous data like page views, device type, and general location.
- This helps me understand which pages are useful and how the site is being accessed. It does not identify who you are.
- No personally identifiable information is collected or stored.

Analytics services may use cookies or similar technologies to function properly. These are used only for analytics purposes.

### No Ads or Trackers

This site does not:

- Show ads
- Use tracking pixels
- Sell or share your data
- Collect unnecessary personal information

### Your Privacy, Your Control
