## April 2025

Not long ago, I stumbled upon a new concept, a new way to write things. A [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). It's different from a _personal blog_, because you don't write a polished article and display them based on the release date. A garden is where you plant things, water and tend it, for it to grow and nurtured. Instead of writing about some topic with a clear finish line and publish it, you write something as-is and let it grow. You add more as you learn and research more about the topic.

This concept sounds lovely to me, because not only I can spend more time writing what I want, I can also publish them whenever I want. This approach reduces a lot of friction for my current _write-flow_. I can immediately write my idea, publish it in the garden, and move on. I can let it grow or die, let it stay as is, or revisit the topic in the future.

I spent a lot of my time to [re-build my site](/site-updates) to accommodate this new concept.
