Develop a Python script that uses Selenium to automate web scraping of data from specified websites. The data will be processed and analyzed using Pandas, and reports will be generated and sent via email. GitHub Actions will be used to schedule and run the scraping tasks periodically.

## Usage

This project involves creating an automated web scraping tool to collect data from various sources, such as news sites or e-commerce platforms. Selenium will handle the interaction with web pages, while Pandas will process the scraped data. GitHub Actions will automate the scraping process on a schedule, ensuring that data is always up-to-date.

## Sample Script

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'https://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract data from the webpage
data = soup.find('div', class_='content')
print(data.text)
```
