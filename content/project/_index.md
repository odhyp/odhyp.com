## I create stuffs.

I'm currently working on [ASIK](https://github.com/odhyp/asik/), a Python GUI application for my 9-to-5. On the front-end, I enjoy working with Hugo, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript.

I'm also in the process of migrating all my projects to make them more presentable here, so please excuse the chaos!
