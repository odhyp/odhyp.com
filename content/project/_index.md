## I create stuffs.

I am currently working on [ASIK](https://github.com/odhyp/asik/), a Python GUI application to generate employee salary slip. My current plan is to create more GUI application and package them as a Python package in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), at least for now.

On the front-end side, I'm planning to make some simple stuffs like Pok√©dex, marketing website, etc.
