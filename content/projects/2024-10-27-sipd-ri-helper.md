**SIPD-RI Helper** is a Python-based command-line application that automates tasks on the [SIPD-RI](https://sipd.kemendagri.go.id/landing) web application. It helps reduce human error and saves time by automating browser actions using Playwright, from login to form submission and data retrieval.

## Features

- Automates browser workflows: login, navigation, form submission, and file downloads
- Retry mechanism for unstable elements (e.g. 404 errors, missing dropdowns)
- CLI interface and readable logging
- Modular structure, easy to tweak or extend for future automation needs
- Can be compiled into `.exe` for use on Windows without Python

## Installation

### Requirements

Before installing, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended over pip)
- SIPD-RI Account

### Recommended (using `uv`)

1. Clone and move to the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/odhyp/sipd-ri.git && cd sipd-ri
    ```

2. Sync dependencies

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3. Install Playwright

    ```bash
    playwright install chromium
    ```

4. Voila! installation success

### (Optional) Running the executable, no Python required

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/odhyp/sipd-ri/releases)
2. Download the `.zip` archive for Windows
3. Extract it
4. Double-click the `.exe` to run the app

## Usage

### Run the CLI App

```bash
uv run main.py
```

> If you installed using `pip` or have `uv` configured, this will launch the interactive CLI menu

### Steps

1. The app will launch a numbered menu with available automation tasks
2. Select your desired task
3. Youâ€™ll be prompted to select the input file if needed
4. The browser will open and begin automation
5. Logs will be generated under `logs/`

## Roadmap

Planned improvements:

- [ ] Update and sync the latest `SKPD` and `Sub SKPD` data
- [x] Rewrite `AKLAP` and `PENATAUSAHAAN` modules for the new SIPD-RI 2025 interface
- [x] Migrate to a modern Python project structure using `uv`
