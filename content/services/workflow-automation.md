I build custom Python scripts that automate repetitive tasks in your daily workflow, from file handling and data processing to reporting and integration.

## What You Get

- Tailored automation based on your specific workflow
- Python scripts for local or cloud-based systems
- One-time or recurring automation
- Clean documentation and easy-to-use scripts

## Who This Is For

- 9-to-5 workers handling too many manual tasks
- Teams juggling spreadsheets, PDFs, or file operations
- Anyone who wants to automate boring, repetitive processes

## How It Works

| Steps | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1. | Discovery call to understand your needs |
| 2. | Proposal with scope and pricing |
| 3. | Script development and testing |
| 4. | Delivery with usage instruction |
| 5. | (Optional) Revisions or updates |

## Pricing

> Starts at USD50

Pricing depends on the complexity, integrations, and scope. For larger automation, I’ll provide a custom quote after our discovery call.

## Frequently Asked Question?

Q: Will I be able to reuse the script later?
Yes — I write clean, reusable code with comments so you can tweak or rerun it easily.

Q: Do I need to install anything?
I’ll provide clear instructions. Most scripts only need Python installed.
