After a long battle with indecisivenessâ€”and after my old site's Vercel deployments broke down because I couldn't upgrade it to use TailwindCSS v4â€”I finally present to you a new look for my website!

<!--more-->

I call this one **Orion**, as it resembles a night sky with starsâ€”_or at least, I think it does?_

This cool look comes from Vercel's template, **[Portfolio Starter Kit]**, which I used as a starting point. From there, I worked on it, added more features, and made it my own. I love its clean and minimal aesthetic, dark background, and lack of distractions. The narrower width (under 700px) is intentionalâ€”honestly, I never know what to do with all that extra space on wider layouts.

That's it! If you happen to find a typo or a bug on the site and want to help improve it, feel free to reach out. You can **[create a new issue]**, drop a comment on the site, or email me. I'd really appreciate it. ðŸ˜Ž
