I call this site, **Orion Extended**. Yes, you read that rightâ€”another new look for my website, just two months after the last one. I'm moving away from the traditional blog-making workflow and trying something different: working with the garage door open, through this Digital Garden.

I donâ€™t really use the whole bi-directional linking thing, I just like the idea of letting pages grow and evolve over time.

After a long battle with indecisivenessâ€”and after my old site's Vercel deployments broke down because I couldn't upgrade it to use TailwindCSS v4â€”I finally present to you a new look for my website!

![Orion Homepage](/img/2025-02-11-01.webp)

I call this one **Orion**, as it resembles a night sky with starsâ€”_or at least, I think it does?_

This cool look comes from Vercel's template, **[Portfolio Starter Kit]**, which I used as a starting point. From there, I worked on it, added more features, and made it my own. I love its clean and minimal aesthetic, dark background, and lack of distractions. The narrower width (under 700px) is intentionalâ€”honestly, I never know what to do with all that extra space on wider layouts.

That's it! If you happen to find a typo or a bug on the site and want to help improve it, feel free to reach out. You can **[create a new issue]**, drop a comment on the site, or email me. I'd really appreciate it. ðŸ˜Ž

Before moving into Hugo, I was using [Jekyll] with [Chirpy theme] by [Cotes Chung] for blogging. All thanks to Techno Tim's video "[Meet Jekyll - The Static Site Generator]".

I didn't know anything about creating a good website back then, since I just started learning HTML and CSS. Discovering Chirpy is definitely a love-at-first-sight moment for me. The minimalist but comprehensive approach, 3-column layout, neutral color, everything just clicked for me.
