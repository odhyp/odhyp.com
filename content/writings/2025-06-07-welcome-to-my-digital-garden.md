Hello and welcome to my digital garden. ðŸ¤“ðŸª´

This space is a little different from a traditional blog. A blog often emphasizes chronology.
New posts push old ones down, and content is expected to be polished and complete.

A digital garden is more organic. Itâ€™s a place where I plant thoughts, tend to them over time, and let them grow at their own pace.

This garden is both a public notebook and a quiet corner of the internet where I can explore ideas without the pressure of perfection.

## Writing Types

Some pieces evolve and blossom, while others stay half-formed, waiting for a spark. Like a real garden, itâ€™s messy, seasonal, and alive.

I organize everything here into four main types:

### Articles

These are my more structured and polished writings. Think guides, tutorials, essays, and deep dives. I take time to shape them clearly, making sure theyâ€™re easy to read or follow, provide enough resources, and of course, opinionated.

### Notes

Notes are quick and informal entries. Consist of things I've learned, code snippets, research, and anything I'm exploring. Often incomplete or open-ended, written more for myself but shared in case they help someone else.

### Ideas

A growing list of sparks, something short, raw, and unfiltered. These could be project concepts, questions I'm asking, patterns I've noticed, or interesting topics I want to explore. They don't follow a structure, more of a written version of my quick thoughts.

### Logs

Ongoing documentation of what I'm working on, learning, or thinking about. This is where time matters in a place where time doesn't matter. Logs help me track progress and capture the journey.

## Growth Stages

Every post on this garden has a growth stage indicating how complete and comprehensive it is. Because not everything in this garden is fully grown and that's the point. This helps set expectations and makes it easier for you (and me) to understand where a piece stands in its lifecycle. Here's how I think about it:

### Sapling ðŸŒ±

A fresh seed of thought. Unpolished and possibly incomplete. These are raw, just-planted thoughts. Think of them as placeholders for something I want to dive in further.

### Growing ðŸŒ¿

Developing with more structure and clarity. I've started to shape the idea, maybe added examples or context. Still a work-in-progress, but there's something to chew on.

### Evergreen ðŸŒ³

Mature and stable. Well-formed, clearly expressed, and (mostly) coherent. A work that is close to finished, though I still leave room for edits or updates.

> In a perfect world, every post would become Evergreen. But some ideas linger as Saplings... half-grown, half-forgotten, and waiting for rain.

## How I Use Them

This garden isnâ€™t just for publishing, itâ€™s for thinking. I use it to:

- Capture ideas before they're gone
- Develop notes into fuller articles over time
- Document progress and experiments
- Reflect on what Iâ€™m learning or building

Youâ€™re welcome to read through any part of the garden, even the messy corners. Just remember that youâ€™re walking through an evolving space, not a polished archive.
