## Articles

_Finalized and structured writings, including guides and tutorials._

This section will hold polished and complete content, whether it's an opinion piece, an in-depth explanation, or a step-by-step guide.

> Insight: Keeping guides under "Articles" makes sense because, in the end, they are structured and meant to provide value in a finished form. This also helps separate them from rougher notes or evolving ideas.

- "Why Static Site Generators Are the Future"
- "How to Optimize Your Website for Speed"
