## Ideas

_A single page filled with bullet lists of sparks, brainstorms, and fleeting ideas._

This is where raw inspiration livesâ€”quick thoughts that may or may not evolve into something bigger. Unlike Notes, these donâ€™t require structure or further explanation.

> Insight: Keeping ideas on a single page prevents clutter while making it easy to scan and revisit. It also separates brainstorming from documentation.

ðŸ“Œ Example Entries:

- "What if we had a decentralized version of GitHub?"
- "An AI-powered journaling app that suggests reflections based on past entries"
