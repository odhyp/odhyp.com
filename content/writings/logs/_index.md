## Logs

_Ongoing documentation and progress tracking of my life, projects, and tech updates._

A collection of journals, progress updates, and reflectionsâ€”whether on a personal project, a learning journey, or tech trends. Unlike Notes, Logs focus more on tracking progress rather than exploring ideas.

> Insight: This is perfect for project-based thinkingâ€”whether it's logging your coding journey, writing about experiments, or reviewing a new technology. Keeping logs separate from articles allows them to be less polished but still structured.

ðŸ“Œ Example Entries:

- "Week 3 of Building My Portfolio Project"
- "Testing the New Hugo 1.0 Release â€“ My Thoughts"
