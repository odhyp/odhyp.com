## Notes

_Rough, unstructured thoughts or research on topics I donâ€™t fully understand yet._

A place for work-in-progress ideas, fragmented thoughts, or things you're still figuring out. Unlike articles, notes are not polished or definitiveâ€”theyâ€™re meant to grow, change, or stay as-is.

> Insight: This is great for capturing raw knowledge before committing to a full article. You can revisit and refine them later!

ðŸ“Œ Example Entries:

- "What Iâ€™m Learning About WebAssembly"
- "A Quick Comparison of SQLite vs PostgreSQL for Small Projects"
